# Royal-Brothers

#### About Royal-Brothers
> We are a bunch of millennials focused on building India‚Äôs largest mobility solutions provider. Our focus has led us to build a platform providing rentals spanning across 14 states, 43 cities and 3 international cities. Transportation and mobility solutions is one of the least understood and most unorganized markets. We see this as an unexplored opportunity to build a system that can be trusted by everyone beyond barriers. We have no limitations when it comes to two wheelers and enjoy serving everything from a scooter to a superbike available on both website and mobile application. We are obsessed with the concept of ‚ÄòWhy buy when you can rent‚Äô.

> In this project I have tried to enhance the cloning of ‚Äúroyal-brothers‚Äù website using frontend with React Js, Material UI, redux and JSON data with validations, signup, login and much more. I had build up all the efforts to do best in this project. As, the Masai School's Mentorship  was specifically to build up skills and I also accordingly implemented all that teachings in the project to look it at its best. Completing this project alone was the most crucial part to get successfully completed on time.
